# pa1 Code READ

This README provides the code, its purpose, usage, and instructions on how to load the code from a JAR file.

## description

This includes the use of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and dynamic arrays, files, loading elements, and reading elements from the directory.
"pa1.java": Class that reads files, operates on data structures, and measures execution time.
"SinglyLinkedList.java": Class that describes the single linked list data structure.
"DynamicArray.java": Class that defines the dynamic array data structure.
"Sample data files: `1Mint.txt` and `50Mint.txt` with integer values."

## Preparation

Install, before running the code.
Java Development Kit (JDK) .
Any Java IDE or code editor of your choice

## Using

Follow these steps to apply this code.

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in the Java IDE or code editor of your choice.

3. Run the "pa1.java" file and use it in the code.

4. Check the time consumption for various operations and data structures.

## Running the Application from JAR

If you want to run the Java application from a JAR file without accessing the source code directly, follow these additional steps:

1. Download the JAR file . Make sure to download the appropriate version of the JAR file for your operating system.

2. Open your command prompt or terminal.

3. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the JAR file using the "cd" (change directory) command.

4. Run the JAR file using the "java" command. Replace "pa1.java" with the actual name of the JAR file you downloaded.

  java -jar pa1.jar 1Mint.txt 50Mint.txt

1.The application will execute, and you will see the output in the console.

#Performance Testing

The code includes performance reviews for the following actions:

Creating arrays from data files.
Inserting an element into the first index.
Inserting an element into the last index.
Reading an element from a specific index.
The code measures the time taken to execute these tasks using sample data files (1Mint.txt and 50Mint.txt).
